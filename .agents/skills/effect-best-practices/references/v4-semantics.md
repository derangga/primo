# v4 Semantics

Core behaviors in Effect v4 that shape daily code. Each section describes the meaning and the pattern to use.

## Ref, Deferred, Fiber, and Option Are Not Effects

`Effect.gen` accepts one thing: a value that is an `Effect`. There is no separate trait that
makes a non-Effect yieldable. `Effect.gen` types its body as
`Generator<Eff extends Effect<any, any, any>, ...>`, so anything else is a compile error.

### What can be yielded

`Effect` itself, and the types that extend it. `Config<T>` is declared as
`interface Config<out T> extends Effect.Effect<T, ConfigError>`, so `yield* Config.String("X")`
works. A `Context.Service` key is an Effect that yields the service.

Custom values join that set through the `Effectable` module rather than a trait. Extend
`Effectable.Class` or wrap a constructor with `Effectable.Mixin`, implement `asEffect()`, and the
resulting values *are* `Effect` values, assignable anywhere an `Effect` is expected:

```typescript
import { Effect, Effectable } from "effect"

class Box {
    constructor(readonly value: number) {}
}

class EffectBox extends Effectable.Mixin(Box) {
    asEffect() {
        return Effect.succeed(this.value)
    }
}

Effect.isEffect(new EffectBox(2)) // true
```

### Not Effects, use the module function

```typescript
// WRONG, not Effects
const value = yield* ref
const result = yield* deferred
const output = yield* fiber
const n = yield* Option.some(42)

// CORRECT
const value = yield* Ref.get(ref)
const result = yield* Deferred.await(deferred)
const output = yield* Fiber.join(fiber)
const n = yield* Effect.fromOption(Option.some(42))  // fails with NoSuchElementError
```

`Option`, `Result`, and `AsyncResult` all fall in this group. `Effect.fromOption(option)` fails
with `NoSuchElementError` by default, or with your own error via
`Effect.fromOption(option, () => new MyError())`. Generator style over `Option` or `Result`
values alone uses `Option.gen` and `Result.gen`, where `yield*` is valid.

**Why it matters:** `Effect.all([refA, refB])` with an array of `Ref`s is a compile error. Read each ref explicitly with `Ref.get`.

## Equality Is Structural by Default

`Equal.equals` uses structural equality for plain objects and arrays:

```typescript
// All true.
Equal.equals({ a: 1 }, { a: 1 })
Equal.equals([1, [2, 3]], [1, [2, 3]])
Equal.equals(new Map([["a", 1]]), new Map([["a", 1]]))
Equal.equals(new Set([1, 2]), new Set([1, 2]))
```

Plain objects, arrays, `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, and `RegExp` are compared by value. Types implementing the `Equal` interface keep their custom logic.

`Equal.equals(NaN, NaN)` is `true`.

### Opting out

```typescript
const obj = Equal.byReference({ a: 1 })
Equal.equals(obj, { a: 1 }) // false
```

- `byReference(obj)` returns a `Proxy` using reference equality; the input object keeps its own identity.
- `byReferenceUnsafe(obj)` marks the object itself; faster, but permanently changes how that object compares.

Use `Equal.asEquivalence()` to derive an `Equivalence` from structural equality.

Object-pair results are cached in a `WeakMap`, so do not mutate an object after you first compare it.

**Watch for this** in caches, `Set`/`Map` keys, and dedup logic where two identical-looking objects collapse into one entry.

## Fiber Keep-Alive Is Built In

The runtime holds the Node process open while a fiber is suspended, using a reference-counted keep-alive timer. This works with plain `Effect.runPromise`:

```typescript
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
    const deferred = yield* Deferred.make<string>()
    yield* Deferred.await(deferred) // process stays alive
})

Effect.runPromise(program)
```

**`runMain` is recommended** for application entry points:

- **Signal handling.** `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` gracefully interrupt the root fiber
- **Exit codes.** Calls `process.exit(code)` on failure or signal
- **Error reporting.** Reports unhandled errors

Use `runMain` for any real application entry point. Scripts and tests stay alive until fibers complete.

## Unstable Modules

Stability is a per-API tag, not an import path. In Effect 4.0.0 the `effect/unstable/*` namespace
no longer exists, and there are no compatibility exports for it. Unstable modules sit at plain
`effect/<area>` paths and say so in their JSDoc with `@stability unstable`.

- **No tag**: strict semver. Breaking changes wait for a major release.
- **`@stability unstable`**: may receive breaking changes in minor releases.
- **`@stability experimental`**: may receive breaking changes in patch releases.

Modules tagged unstable in `effect` 4.0.0: `ai`, `cli`, `cluster`, `devtools`, `encoding`,
`eventlog`, `http`, `http-api`, `net`, `observability`, `persistence`, `process`, `reactivity`,
`rpc`, `schema`, `socket`, `sql`, `testing/TestSchema`, `workers`, `workflow`, and the top-level
`Arbitrary` module. `Schema`, `JsonSchema`, `Config`, `Stream`, `Layer`, `Cause`,
`testing/TestClock` and the rest of the core are stable. `effect/schema` is the small unstable one:
it holds `Model`, `VariantSchema` and the JIT and AOT schema compilers. The `Schema` module itself
is stable at `effect/Schema`, with a few unstable exports such as the `NetAddress` schemas.

APIs that wrap a third-party dependency are tagged unstable too, because that dependency can
change underneath them. That covers the Redis clients, the `@effect/platform-node/Undici` and `ws`
re-exports, driver-specific options in the `@effect/sql-*` packages, the provider clients and
generated schemas in `@effect/ai-*`, `@effect/opentelemetry`, and the `vitest` re-export in
`@effect/vitest`.

Practical consequences:

- Import from the top-level path: `effect/http`, `effect/http-api`, `effect/rpc`, `effect/cluster`,
  `effect/workflow`, `effect/sql`, `effect/reactivity`, `effect/ai`, `effect/cli`. An old
  `effect/unstable/http` import is a build error.
- Use a caret range on `effect` only if you can absorb minor-release breakage in the modules
  above. Pin an exact version when HTTP, RPC, cluster, or atom code is on the critical path.
- All Effect ecosystem packages share **one version number**. `effect`, `@effect/sql-pg`,
  `@effect/atom-react`, `@effect/vitest` must all be on the same version.
- Moving a module out of `unstable/` did not stabilize it. Check the `@stability` tag before
  treating an API as frozen.

## Other Core Behaviors

**Layer memoization is shared across `Effect.provide` calls.** Overlapping layers reuse the same instance. Opt out with `Layer.fresh` or `Effect.provide(layer, { local: true })` for a separate instance. See `layer-patterns.md`.

**`Cause` is flat.** A `Cause` wraps `reasons: ReadonlyArray<Reason>` where `Reason` is `Fail | Die | Interrupt`. See `error-patterns.md`.

Use `Context<R>` and `Effect.runForkWith(services)` for runtime composition. The `Runtime` module holds `Teardown`, `defaultTeardown`, and `makeRunMain`. See `resource-patterns.md`.

**`Effect.gen` takes `self` in an options object.** Use `Effect.gen({ self: this }, fn)`.

Fiber-local state is `Context.Reference`, read by yielding it and set with `Effect.provideService`. Built-ins live in the `References` module (`References.CurrentLogLevel`, `References.MinimumLogLevel`, ...). See `service-patterns.md`.
